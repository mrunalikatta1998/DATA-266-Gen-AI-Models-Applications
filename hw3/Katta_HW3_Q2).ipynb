However, Paper 3 identifies one limitation of diffusion models, which is their inability to effectively handle complex, fine-grained controls such as syntactic structure. This suggests that while diffusion models may struggle with generating long sequences that require intricate structures and detailed contextualization, they still have potential for improving controllable text generation. \n",
